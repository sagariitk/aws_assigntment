#lambda function that will always throw an error because the dynamodb table name is provided wrong

import boto3

client=boto3.client('ec2')
dynamo=boto3.client('dynamodb')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    response = dynamo.scan(
    TableName='sagarq',
    )
    item=response['Items']
    return item
    

#then I made a python file on ec2 instance to invoke this function asyc type

import boto3
import json
client=boto3.client('lambda')

input={
"input1":"something"
}

response = client.invoke_async(
    FunctionName='string',
    InvokeArgs=json.dumps(input)
)

print response

#I printed the response and got the error with the error code 202
 which says "The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed.
 The request might or might not eventually be acted upon, as it might be disallowed when processing actually takes place."

Since I had not bucket named "sagarq" in the dynamodb so it might throw this error which says that 
the request has been accepted but not eventually acted upon
